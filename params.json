{"name":"Brysonresume","tagline":"My Resume, since every good Open Source professional keeps a copy on GitHub","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n###CAREER EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n2012-Present\tAlcatel-Lucent, Principal Wireless Chief Technical Officer\r\nCreated end to end strategic solutions for customers using advanced LTE wireless technology resulting in increased feature revenue and improved user experience for wireless users. \r\nPerformed RF optimization and RF planning improving network efficiency and utilization for customers.\r\nLeveraging machine learning and big data techniques resulting in new data insights to help improve wireless network performance by more than 30%. \r\nUse of open source cloud based API’s and virtualized Linux containers for network intensity mapping and network analysis to discover optimal cell placement for cost versus performance improvements in live data networks.\r\n\r\n2008-2012 \tAlcatel-Lucent, Solutions Specification Architect\r\nModeled and delivered architecture for distributed load balancing algorithms using IBM Rhapsody for multi-processor architecture to more than double deployed hardware capacity.\r\nLed international development team in Bangladesh, India using AGILE and Scrum development techniques to deliver IBM Rhapsody model driven project 1.5 times faster than traditional process delivery without quality tradeoff. \r\n \r\n2004-2008 \tLucent Technologies, Chief CDMA/EVDO  Architect \r\nDesigned packet data hardware architecture and multi-carrier allocation technology in 3G EVDO wireless system resulting in 3x bandwidth improvement over current 3G architectures.\r\nDesigned architecture for 3G Radio Network Controller (RNC) Groups creating a 64x virtual networking expansion of the coverage area and a distributed load management architecture on a single logical machine.
